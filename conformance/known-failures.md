# Conformance known failures

These records track executed corpus failures; they are not accepted accuracy-policy
deviations. Every record blocks the M2 exit until the engine conforms or the documented
behaviour is deliberately resolved in `plans/product/03-accuracy-policy.md`. The harness
still runs every excluded case, so a fix makes its exclusion fail as stale.

**Who owns what.** C9 (`plans/engine/complete/M2-task-C9-s3m-conformance-repairs.md`,
landed) left the one S3M record below; its exclusion row points here. C5
(`plans/engine/M2-task-C5-quirks-and-tempo-models.md`) left one MOD record,
`C2-MOD-001`, which is a **harness** record rather than an engine one: the replay it
covers agrees with the oracle tick for tick.
No MTM case is recorded here. The ProTracker fidelity repairs and the mixer
voice-boundary sample swap landed as
`plans/engine/complete/M2-task-C3b-protracker-fidelity-repairs.md` (landed); the four MOD cases that task
file listed as targets but did not fix turned out to be oracle-representation
differences, and each now cites `plans/product/03-accuracy-policy.md` — D21 for
ProTracker's tick-zero `E9x` retrigger (`openmpt-mod-delay-break`), D22 for its
tick-zero instrument latch under `EDx` (`openmpt-mod-portamento-swap-pt`), and D18 for a
queued stop that falls due inside a tick interval, which makes libxmp omit the channel
for that whole tick (`openmpt-mod-swap-no-loop`,
`openmpt-mod-portamento-sample-change-pt`).
The harness repairs — trace alignment, loop-aware position comparison, the D18 adapter
projection, the per-field waiver and the tick budget — landed as
`plans/engine/complete/M2-task-C2a-conformance-harness-repairs.md`, so every first divergence
quoted below is one the repaired harness observed, not an alignment position.

The ten tracker-dialect cases — the Imago Orpheus, ModPlug 1.16 and ST3.01 flow modes
libxmp selects from the `cwtv` field, and the Octalyser and Digital Tracker MOD tags —
were never failures against StarPlayer's reference, and C5 has landed their
`FormatDialect` and `QuirkSet` fields. Nine of the ten now pass; the tenth is
`C2-MOD-001` below. The MOD failures are not recorded
here either: the ProTracker fidelity repairs and the voice-boundary sample swap are
`plans/engine/M2-task-C3b-protracker-fidelity-repairs.md`. The harness repairs — trace
alignment, loop-aware position comparison, the D18 adapter projection, the per-field
waiver and the tick budget — landed as
`plans/engine/complete/M2-task-C2a-conformance-harness-repairs.md`, so every first
divergence quoted below is one the repaired harness observed, not an alignment position.

## C2-S3M-009 — the Rxy tremolo phase and its first tick

`ParamMemory.s3m` is the last S3M record. Its shared parameter memory, the effect it
exists to test, now agrees for every family through row 58 of 63 with `period` and
`position` waived under accuracy-policy D39 (libxmp truncates the S3M vibrato in its
Amiga period domain, so `H82` moves its period by 8 quarter-units where ST3 moves it by
11). The remaining first divergence is **tick 353 channel 0 on `volume`, 64 expected
against 59 actual**, on the `Rxy` rows, and it has two parts:

1. ST3's `M_FX_R` reads and advances `_VibCount`, the phase it shares with `Hxy` and
   `Uxy`, so a preceding `Kxy` vibrato leaves the tremolo mid-waveform. libxmp and
   OpenMPT both give the tremolo its own position, which starts at zero here.
2. libxmp applies the tremolo delta on the first tick of a row as well, using the phase
   un-advanced, where the original runs `Rxy` only as a minor effect.

Both would also change `Hxy`'s tick-zero behaviour if adopted, which no corpus case
currently pins, so neither was changed on speculation. Resolving this needs a decision on
whether ST3 really shares `_VibCount` between vibrato and tremolo — the tremolo depth
scale itself was resolved and is accuracy-policy D35.

## C2-MOD-001 — pairing a waived timeline across a tempo change

`pattern_loop_dt.mod` is a Digital Tracker fixture whose `FA06` tag and
`FLOW_MODE_DTM_2015` pattern-loop dialect C5 implemented. The replay is correct: the
complete 488-tick `(row, tick_in_row)` sequence StarPlayer produces is **identical** to
the oracle's, and the four sibling Octalyser and Digital Tracker cases pass with the same
waivers.

What fails is the comparison. The module alternates 255 BPM at speed 3 with 63 BPM at
speed 1, and accuracy-policy D15 — ProTracker's CIA latch, which defers an `Fxx >= 32`
tempo to the next tracker event — puts StarPlayer's timeline one interval behind
libxmp's at every tempo command. The resulting frame offset therefore *flips* between
about −840 and +470 at each change, a step of some 1300 frames. `pair_by_time` in
`crates/starplayer-testkit/src/conformance.rs` re-derives that offset only **after** a
successful pairing and matches within a 45-frame tolerance, so at each flip three records
fail to pair, fall back to the neighbouring tick, and are compared against the wrong row.
The first such mismatch is **tick 121 on `row`, 1 expected against 0 actual**.

Fixing it means re-anchoring the residual offset on `(row, tick_in_row)` whenever a
pairing fails, which is harness work and belongs to the C2a family
(`plans/engine/complete/M2-task-C2a-conformance-harness-repairs.md`), not to C5. It is
recorded here rather than as an accuracy-policy deviation because nothing about
StarPlayer's replay is being accepted as different.

## Resolved by M2-C9

`C2-S3M-001` through `C2-S3M-008` are closed. `libxmp-s3m-pattern-loop-st321`,
`libxmp-s3m-pattern-loop-st321-breakjump`, `openmpt-s3m-amiga-limits`,
`openmpt-s3m-frequency-limits`, `openmpt-s3m-pattern-delays-retrigger`,
`openmpt-s3m-period-limit`, `openmpt-s3m-portamento-sample-change` and
`libxmp-s3m-sample-portamento` all pass, seven of them with a per-field waiver naming an
accuracy-policy entry for a libxmp representation difference (D19, D36, D37, D38, D39)
rather than an engine gap. The engine repairs behind them are accuracy-policy D24–D35.
`libxmp-s3m-pattern-loop-mpt-breakjump`, a C5 dialect case, began passing as a side
effect of the ST3.21 flow repairs and no longer carries an exclusion.

## Resolved by M2-C5

The ten tracker-dialect cases are closed except for `C2-MOD-001` above.
`libxmp-s3m-pattern-loop-imf-breakjump` and `libxmp-s3m-pattern-loop-st301-breakjump`
pass with **no** waiver at all and their exclusion rows are gone;
`libxmp-s3m-pattern-loop-imf`, `-mpt`, `-st301` and the four Octalyser / Digital Tracker
MOD cases pass under per-field waivers naming accuracy-policy D15, D19, D36, D37, D38 and
the new D40. Every one of those is a representation or timeline difference against the
oracle, not an engine gap.
